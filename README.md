### Methodology

For the swift lessons, I learned how 
to implement

* Lesson 2 - Class, Array, Struct

The next step should be learning how 
to create simple apps, such as an 
instrument, a to do list, using midi 
player or audio files, bingo app, 
and/or war card game (pick two random 
cards, keep score)
